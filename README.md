# Overview
Ateneo ventilator (A-vent) project is a low-cost and intelligent mechanical ventilator was developed under [Ateneo Innovation Center](https://www.ateneoinnovation.org/) (AIC) at [Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu/) started during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The project development consist of 3 phases, the following are:
* **Phase 1** Design and development of intelligent A-vent unit
* **Phase 2** Modular alarm: real-time detection of PVA (patient-ventilator asynchrony) and machine problems
* **Phase 3** Wireless real-time monitoring: applied IoT (Internet of Things), digital twin of A-vent

## Phase 1
COVID-19 pandemic is a respiratory diseas resulted in high demand for mechanical ventilator. During the peak of pandemic, the healthcare provider around the world overwhelmed the healthcare system and lacks with mechanical ventilator unit for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The alternative solution for the ventilator demand is to use an open-source based ventilator machine was first introduced by [MIT emergency ventilator](https://emergency-vent.mit.edu/). The pandemic opens a new opportunity for institutions, and organizations worldwide to developed a low-cost ventilator machine, and the AIC was one of the respondent to that situation.

The design and development of A-vent was inspired by





The A-vent unit can delivered a pressurized air with constant rate controlled by microprocessor unit

This repository emphasize the intelligent alarm device for detecting patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and wireless sensor for remote monitoring of machine and patient interaction.
